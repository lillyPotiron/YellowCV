I realized this project within the framework of my training with **OpenClassRoom**, here are the instructions: 
You have just started as a freelance web developer and a potential client, who runs a dog grooming business, spots you on LinkedIn. However, your CV is not quite up to date. In order to be able to answer his questions (and find new clients) you decide to create your own website to present your CV and thus be able to answer his questions. You choose to develop your site in HTML and CSS.

To avoid paying for a server in the first place, you decide to host your site on GitHub Pages. So you immediately create an account to test this service. Satisfied with the simplicity of the process, you do some more research on the criteria for a good online CV, and finally choose this template :

Your site needs to be accessible at all times, from any device, so make sure you have a responsive display that fits both computers and mobiles.
